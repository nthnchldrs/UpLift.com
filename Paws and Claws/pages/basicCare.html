                <p>Caring for pets requires dedication, love, and understanding of their specific needs. Here's a brief guide on how to provide the best care for both dogs and cats, ensuring they lead happy, healthy lives.</p>

                <section class="animal-care-section">
                    <h2>Dogs</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Feed your dog a balanced diet suitable for their age, size, and activity level. Consult with a veterinarian to choose the best food that meets your dog's nutritional needs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Regular exercise is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight and emotional well-being. Provide regular daily walks, playtime, and mental stimulation to keep them fit and happy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Health Care:</strong> Regular check-ups with a veterinarian are essential. Keep up with vaccinations, flea and tick prevention, and dental care to prevent common health issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> Depending on the breed, dogs may need regular haircuts to keep them clean and comfortable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Training and Socialization:</strong> Early training and socialization are key to raising a well-behaved dog. Positive reinforcement techniques strengthen your bond and ensure they are well-adjusted.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                <section class="animal-care-section">
                    <h2>Cats</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Provide a high-quality diet that's appropriate for their life stage. Cats are obligate carnivores, so look for foods with high protein content.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exercise and Play:</strong> Cats need regular playtime to stay active and mentally stimulated. Interactive toys and climbing structures can help satisfy their natural instincts.</li>
                        <li><strong>Health Care:</strong> Regular veterinary visits are important for vaccinations, parasite control, and monitoring their health. Dental care is also crucial to prevent diseases.</li>
                        <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> Most cats are proficient self-groomers, but regular brushing helps reduce hairballs and maintain coat health. Long-haired breeds may require more frequent grooming.</li>
                        <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Provide a safe and enriching environment with access to clean water, a litter box, scratching posts, and safe hiding spaces to support their well-being.</li>
                    </ol>
                </section>

                <section class="animal-care-section">
                    <h2>Small Animals (gerbils, ferrets, etc.)</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Each type of small animal has its own dietary requirements. For example, guinea pigs need a diet high in Vitamin C, while rabbits thrive on high-fiber hay. Research your pet's specific needs to provide a balanced diet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Habitat:</strong> To stay clean and secure habitat is vital. Ensure the enclosure is large enough for them to move freely, with separate areas for sleeping, eating, and eliminating. Bedding should be safe and absorbent, changed regularly to keep the environment clean.</li>
                        <li><strong>Exercise and Stimulation:</strong> Small animals need regular opportunities to exercise and explore outside their cage in a secure area. Toys and accessories that encourage natural behaviors like chewing, burrowing, and climbing are also important for mental stimulation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Health Care:</strong> Regular check-ups with a veterinarian experienced in small animal care are essential. Be aware of common health issues and signs of illness, such as changes in eating habits, lethargy, or unusual discharge.</li>
                        <li><strong>Special Needs:</strong> Many small animals are social and thrive with companionship. Consider keeping them in pairs or groups, depending on their species and individual temperaments, to prevent loneliness and encourage natural social behavior.</li>
                        <li><strong>Handling and Bonding:</strong> Gentle handling from an early age helps in bonding and socializing your pet. However, always be mindful of their size and fragility. Some small animals can become stressed or frightened if handled too much or improperly.</li>
